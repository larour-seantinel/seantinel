# Seantinel

## How Claude talks here

Simple language. Direct. No verbiage. As short as possible.

Applies to everything: answers, discussions, status, errors, and anything written.

- Short sentences. Plain words. No filler.
- Say the fact, then the consequence, then the question. Nothing else.
- No hedging. If something is unverified, say "unverified" and stop.
- Do not restate what Eric just said back to him.
- Do not explain reasoning unless he asks why.
- No bold, no bullet padding, no markdown decoration in conversation.
- Never write three sentences where one works.

## Purpose

Seantinel is a web application that renders sea level rise projections in 3D using NASA data and WebGL. Users can explore different regions of the world and visualize how coastlines change under various sea level rise scenarios.

## Environment

- Hardware: Samsung Android phone running Samsung DeX with external screen (Chromebook display)
- Terminal: Termux
- Runtime: Browser (no server-side rendering)
- Language: JavaScript (plain JS, no TypeScript)
- Rendering: Three.js (same stack as VESL/ISSM)
- ISSM: cloned to `~/issm` — mesh engine, BAMG mesher, JS model classes, Emscripten WASM wrappers
- NASA data sources: altimetry DEM (ICESat-2 / SRTM / Copernicus) — to be finalized
- Dev server: Vite (not yet scaffolded)
- How to run: `npm run dev` (unverified — package.json not yet created)

Open questions:
- Which altimetry dataset? (ICESat-2, SRTM, Copernicus DEM)
- Get `issm-binaries.js` from VESL server or compile via Emscripten?
- Target browsers / mobile support?

## Layout

Tracked (source):
- `src/` — application code
- `public/` — static assets
- `CLAUDE.md`, `LEARNINGS.md`, `TODO.md`
- `package.json`, config files

Ignored:
- `node_modules/`
- `dist/`, `build/`
- `data/` — downloaded NASA datasets
- `output/`

## Current Status

Two artifacts shipped and feature-complete:

1. **Website** — live at `seantinel.pages.dev` (repo `github.com/larour-seantinel/seantinel`, Cloudflare Pages autobuild on `git push`). Currently shows only the Haig glacier (30 yr transient on a 3D textured mountain landscape).
2. **Android APK** — `android-spike/build/spike.apk` runs the full ISSM native stack on-device: fork+exec `issm.exe` via `libissmexe.so`, np≥2 via patched `libmpiexec.so`, 2D + 3D meshes, draped surfaces, transient step slider, z-exag slider, frozen colorbar. Install via Downloads tap (wireless adb blocked on Samsung).

Next step: **pivot to Seantinel core** — NASA DEM + satellite drape + rising-water plane for a coastal location, driven by QR codes that encode location in the URL.

Shipped history and build details live in [DONE.md](DONE.md) and
[LEARNINGS-archive.md](LEARNINGS-archive.md) — not auto-loaded.

## Screenshots

Samsung DeX screenshots land at `~/storage/shared/DCIM/Screenshots/`. Read the latest with:
```
ls -lt ~/storage/shared/DCIM/Screenshots/ | head -3
```
Then `Read` the full path to view it.

## Conventions

- Scripts named by function: `fetch-nasa-data.sh`, `process-tiles.py`, etc.
- Outputs go in `output/` (ignored by git)
- NASA data goes in `data/` (ignored by git)

## Tracking Files

Read LEARNINGS.md and TODO.md at the start of every session.
